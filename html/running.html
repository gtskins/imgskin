The temple is almost accurately recreated to look like a real one, outside it you will find two buttons. One button resets the map if you ever mess up and want to start over again. You have the choice to loot the temple with nothing at all since it is very much possible, but if you want to have the ideal tools you want for a speedrun, press the other button.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The tools you will receive are a few blocks, a pickaxe, torches for light and a water bucket. There is tnt inside the hidden room just like a real temple so be aware. The loot inside the chests are basically what you would commonly see in a normal temple.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The map is pretty much enclosed in barriers, with a prototype temple nearby that is used to clone and reset the other one.&nbsp;</p>
